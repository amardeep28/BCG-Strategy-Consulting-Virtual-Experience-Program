# BCG-Strategy-Consulting-Virtual-Experience-Program

Completed Boston Consulting Group (BCG)'s Strategy Consulting on Forage.

- Completed a job simulation where I advised a hypothetical local telco
  company, Company X, facing a decline in profits.
- Conducted market research to determine the feasibility of the proposed
  solution.
- Used excel to build a model to predict the potential profitability of the
  proposed solution.
- Communicated a summary of key findings in a clear presentation to
  stakeholders.

In the simulation I learned how to think creatively by challenging the assumptions that guide todayâ€™s thinking.
